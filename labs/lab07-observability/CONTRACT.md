# Lab 7 contract

- `lab.json` declares this snapshot's capabilities and resource-dependent live checks.
- `harness lab-info` renders the declaration without requiring cloud access.
- `pytest checks/` runs offline without Foundry, ACA, MCP servers, or telemetry resources.
- This folder is standalone and retains all checks from preceding labs.
